## Entry 1: Balance Abstraction with the Best Factory Pattern

### Option 1: Factory Method Approach

I think that using the Factory Method pattern in order to generate a common Graph abstraction that hides the differences between the two implementations of the
graphs is a very good approach. Both of these Graph implementations can be constructed in the same factory since there is no real different between the two
graphs aside from the data structures used.Therefore, it makes perfect sense, in my opinion, to approach this problem via the Factory Method Pattern. Again, the reasoning
behind this being the fact that this approach will **hide the differences** between the two separate representations of the Graphs.

I created a **very preliminary** sketch of what this might look like below:

Again, the idea behind this approach is the reasoning that we can hide the differences between the two graphs implementations and construct them in the same factory.

### Option 2: Abstract Factory Approach

The second option of using an abstract factory approach also could apply to our problem. Since there are substantial differences regarding the **data structures**
used by the graph implementations, it makes sense to group them up as **families of related objects**. This approach would mean that we have two separate factories
which both differently handle the construction of the graphs.

Again, I have made a **preliminary sketch** of what this might loook like regarding an implemetation below.

## Entry 2: Primary Functionality (with Singleton?)

We are going to refine the Domain Layer by satisfying **US1, US2, and US3**. For reference, I am restating those use cases below:

	1. **US1**: As a researcher, to identify the optimal shortest path implementation to use for a given
graph, I want to compare the performance of an algorithmâ€™s 2D Array implementation with its
corresponding List implementation.
	2. **US2**: As a researcher, to identify performance bugs in a shortest-path implementation, I want to
compute the average execution time of the implementation in different situations.
	3. **US3**: As a researcher, to compare the performance characteristics of algorithms on weighted
and unweighted graphs, I want to easily convert an existing weighted graph to an unweighted
graph.

Lets start by applying the ADD process to our design based off of the **Domain Model** provided in the document. I have posted it below for reference:

![DomainModel](images/InitialDomainModel.png)

I have also put in the high level design so that we can understand how are changes will affect the overall existing architecture of the system:

![ArchitecturalModel](images/InitialArchitecture.png)

#### ADD Iteration 1: Review Inputs

Our inputs here are going to be the user scenarios that are shown above the Domain Model, along with the Domain Model. These changes will be taking place within
the Domain layer of the high level architectural design above.

#### ADD Iteration 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers

For this iteration, our goal is going to be to refine our Domain Model diagram so that we can satisfy our drivers, which are the user scenarios.

#### ADD Iteration 3: Choose One of More Elements of the System to Refine

We will be refining the Domain Model provided here, since it is really our only system element that we can adjust to accomplish our drivers.
